# Angular Invaders

This project was created to play around with Angular. It is loosely designed like an ECS (no components) and has a game loop. 

## Demo

You can try a live demo at: `http://invaders.brunocarvalhal.com`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
